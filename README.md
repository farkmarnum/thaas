# THAAS
Tom Hanks As A Service


## Mission
It should be possible to summon a picture of Tom Hanks on any platform just by typing a single command.


## Integrations

### GitHub

To install, add the GitHub Action:
```
todo
```

Then, use the command in a PR comment:
```
!thaas
```


### Slack

First, install the Slack app for your organization.

<!-- TODO: add instructions -->

Then, use the command in a post:
```
/thaas
```


### API

Want to build your own Tom Hanks solution? You can access the API at https://api.thaas.io.

```
curl -s https://api.thaas.io/api/v1/tom?params=here > tom.png
```

This API is also the backend for all other platform integrations.


## TODOs
### On the roadmap
- normalize the size of the toms (offline)
- add some more toms (offline)
